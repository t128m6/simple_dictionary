#Simple Dictionary is a program that allows you to type words in one of two languages and translate it to the other one.
#
#
#The wordlist can be found and easily expanded in the file "dic.txt"
#
#For new entries use the following format: "Word1 Word1_translated" it doesn't matter in which order they get typed since the program will give the opposite word as an result #anyway. 
#
#
#
#Don't forget to make a new line after every pair of words!
